HTML_TEMPLATE_PROMPT = """
You are a senior HTML developer tasked with creating a General Reusable HTML template for social media posts. Your goal is to replicate the design and typography exactly as shown in the reference image provided.

Instructions:

HTML Structure:
Post Topic: {}
Create the html template for the given post topic, 

Create a single, standalone Python Formatable html string with no external CSS or JavaScript.
Must be Python Formatable string, so use "{{{{}}}}" for normal-css-syntax curly braces and "{{<variable_name>}}" for input variables. 

Variables To include:
 - background_image_url : for the inserting background image url
 - logo_url : for inserting logo url

Variables to Generate:
 - Generate simple variables for headline, subtext , highlight text, font_color, highlight_font color etc. Keep it simple and short and dont create too many variables.


Structure the content using only <div> elements.

Text should be placed exactly as shown in the image.

-> Typography and Design:

	* Replicate the exact fonts, font sizes, line heights, colors, and letter spacing from the image.
	* Match the highlighted headline style, including background color, padding, positioning, and box styling.
  * Use Placeholder text and image src links in template
	* The background or image area should be defined using an <img> tag 
	* Use placeholder variables for image src links. For the background image use resolution 1024x1536.

-> CSS Styling:

	* Use a <style> tag in the <head> of the HTML file for all CSS.
	* Do not use JavaScript.
	* Use Flexbox or absolute positioning based on which better matches the visual layout from the image.
	* No need to import social media icons, or arrowsâ€”they are assumed to be part of the image and will be handled separately.

-> No External Dependencies:
	* Do not use external icons, or libraries.
	* The file must be fully self-contained and portable.
  * No Emojis or watermarks

Output:
A Python Formatable html string along with its json input template.

```html
HTML_STRING
```
